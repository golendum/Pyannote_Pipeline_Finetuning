        "[pyannote.audio](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio) is an open-source toolkit written in Python for speaker diarization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Version 2.1 introduces a major overhaul of the default speaker diarization pipeline, made of three main stages: speaker segmentation applied to a short sliding window, neural speaker embedding of each (local) speakers, and (global) agglomerative clustering.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite its decent out-of-the-box performance, the default pipeline may suffer from the domain mismatch problem (common to most machine learning models) and not perform well on your own data. This tutorial will guide you through two recipes to adapt it to your own data and (hopefully) get better performance. Depending on the number and duration of labeled conversations, you may either focus on optimizing hyper-parameters or additionally fine-tune the internal speaker segmentation model."
